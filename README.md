# Neural System Modeling

This project demonstrates **system modeling using neural networks in MATLAB**.  
It includes two approaches:

1. **Time-Delay Neural Network (TDNN)** for STR dataset (`STR_data.csv`)  
2. **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** for Lab1 dataset (`Lab1_X.mat`, `Lab1_y.mat`)

The goal is to model system dynamics and predict outputs based on input signals.
